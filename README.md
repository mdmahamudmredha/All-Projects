**Overview**
A complete end-to-end **Student Exam Analytics** project where performance data is analyzed using **BigQuery SQL**, **visualized with Power BI**, and extended with **clustering via Machine Learning**.

The project begins with deep **SQL-based EDA**, including custom metrics like actual mark calculation, pass/fail classification, performance trend tracking using `LAG()`, and ranking of top performers. It then transitions into **interactive dashboards** in Power BI to visualize attendance trends, performance changes, and pass rate over time.

Finally, the project applies **KMeans clustering** on student behavior (e.g., mark%, time taken) to segment students into groups like fast & accurate, slow but low scorer, etc. These segments offer valuable insights for educators to deliver **personalized feedback** and improve outcomes.

** Tools & Technologies**:
BigQuery SQL, Power BI, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook

** Key Concepts**:
Student Performance Analysis, Exam Result Classification, Time-based Performance Trend, Clustering (KMeans), Business Intelligence, DAX Measures

** Techniques Used**:
* SQL Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions (`LAG()`, `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)
* Percentage-based mark calculation
* Time duration handling using `TIMESTAMP_DIFF`
* DAX for day-wise, weekly trend visualizations
* KMeans Clustering on performance & behavior metrics
* Insightful labeling of clusters and interpretation

** Visuals in Power BI**:
* Day-wise Exam Attendance (Line Chart)
* Stacked Bar Chart: Daily Attempts by Exam
* Top 5 Students per Exam (Rank + Time)
* Performance Trend (Improved / Declined / Same)
* Decline-heavy Exams (Bar Chart)
* Most Improved in 2nd Attempt (Filtered Table)
* Cluster-based student categorization

** Clustering Insights**:
* Grouped students by speed and accuracy
* Interpreted behavior using average mark %, time taken
* Used results to suggest personalized student feedback

** Video Walkthroughs**:

**Overview**
A real-world **Python-based marketing analytics project** where customers are segmented using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model and then clustered using **K-Means**. This enables businesses to target specific groups like Diamond, Gold, Silver Customers, and high-value shoppers based on purchase behavior.

This project demonstrates how RFM and ML clustering can be combined to generate **actionable business insights** from raw transaction data.

**Tools & Technologies**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: Online Retail (CSV)

**Key Concepts**
- Customer Segmentation
- RFM Scoring & Clustering
- Business Intelligence
- Visual Analytics
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Interpretation of Clusters for Business Strategy

**Techniques Used**
- Handling Missing Values (CustomerID null logic)
- Feature Engineering: Recency (InvoiceDate), Frequency (InvoiceNo), Monetary (Quantity √ó UnitPrice)
- RFM Scoring (Log-transformed & scaled if needed)
- KMeans Clustering (with optimal k)
- Segment Labelling: Gold, Silver, Diamond using custom logic
- Insightful Features:
  - Revenue contribution by segment
  - Region-wise Diamond/Gold/Silver customers (pie chart)
  - CLV estimation

**Advanced Business Insights Extracted**
> We designed 15+ powerful analytics queries on top of RFM clusters, such as:
- What % of revenue comes from Diamond customers?
- From which regions do Diamond customers come?
- Which segment has the highest AOV?
- Are top 20% customers contributing to 80% of revenue?
- Month-over-month total sales trend

**Visual Snapshots**
- ‚úÖ Region-wise customer pie charts
- ‚úÖ Monthly sales line graph
- ‚úÖ Boxplots by segment
- ‚úÖ Top customer tables
