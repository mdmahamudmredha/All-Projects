**Overview**
A complete end-to-end **Student Exam Analytics** project where performance data is analyzed using **BigQuery SQL**, **visualized with Power BI**, and extended with **clustering via Machine Learning**.

The project begins with deep **SQL-based EDA**, including custom metrics like actual mark calculation, pass/fail classification, performance trend tracking using `LAG()`, and ranking of top performers. It then transitions into **interactive dashboards** in Power BI to visualize attendance trends, performance changes, and pass rate over time.

Finally, the project applies **KMeans clustering** on student behavior (e.g., mark%, time taken) to segment students into groups like fast & accurate, slow but low scorer, etc. These segments offer valuable insights for educators to deliver **personalized feedback** and improve outcomes.

** Tools & Technologies**:
BigQuery SQL, Power BI, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebook

** Key Concepts**:
Student Performance Analysis, Exam Result Classification, Time-based Performance Trend, Clustering (KMeans), Business Intelligence, DAX Measures

** Techniques Used**:
* SQL Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions (`LAG()`, `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`)
* Percentage-based mark calculation
* Time duration handling using `TIMESTAMP_DIFF`
* DAX for day-wise, weekly trend visualizations
* KMeans Clustering on performance & behavior metrics
* Insightful labeling of clusters and interpretation

** Visuals in Power BI**:
* Day-wise Exam Attendance (Line Chart)
* Stacked Bar Chart: Daily Attempts by Exam
* Top 5 Students per Exam (Rank + Time)
* Performance Trend (Improved / Declined / Same)
* Decline-heavy Exams (Bar Chart)
* Most Improved in 2nd Attempt (Filtered Table)
* Cluster-based student categorization
